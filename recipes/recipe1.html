<h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Pre-heat oven 200°C, Fan 180°C, Gas Mark 6</li>
    <li>Put the onion, beetroot, carrot, potatoes, garlic, and herbs into a roasting tray and season them well with salt and pepper and add olive oil.<br/>
    Mix well so that all the vegetables are covered in oil. (Add a little more if necessary).</li>
    <li>Place into the oven and cook for approx 40-50 mins, stirring once halfway through cooking. The spinach will need to be added to these vegetables.<br/>
      (5 mins from completion of cooking time.)</li>
    <li>When the vegetables have been in the oven for 20 minutes, start cooking the Gressingham duck breasts. <br/>
      Place an empty roasting tray in to the oven to keep it warm.</li>
    <li>Take the breasts and lightly score the skin and pat dry. Place the breasts skin side down in a frying pan on a low to medium heat with no oil.</br>
      Cook for 6-8 minutes until the skin is golden and crispy. Be sure to carefully pour off any excess fat as it is cooking.</li>
    <li>Once the skin is crispy, flip the duck over and sear the meat for 30 seconds.Transfer to the warm baking tray and place in the oven to <br/>
         cook for 12 mins for a medium rare result (leave in the oven for longer if you like your duck well done.)</li>
    <li>Remove from the oven and allow to rest until the vegetables are cooked.</li>
    <li>Once the spinach has been added and cooked through, remove from the oven, pour over the balsamic syrup, mix well with</br>
       the vegetables and serve onto 2 plates. Carve the duck and place on top of the vegetables. Serve.</li>
